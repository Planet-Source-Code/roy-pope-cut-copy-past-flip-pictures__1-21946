Here's a simple demonstration of how to select areas within a picture, copy or cut them to the clipboard, then paste them back into the original picture.

Some of this code was taken and modified from BoBo Enterprises Image Workshop 1.1 (found at PSC - Thanx guys). Many bugs were fixed by me in BoBo's approach to these activities... especially in the area selection.

The code is not documented, but a somewhat experienced VB programmer should get the idea of what is happening really early in the code.

There's also a demo button that allows you to flip the picture. If an area has been selected, only the selection will be flipped. To unselect an area, simply click the picture outside the selected area, or rightclick the selected area.
